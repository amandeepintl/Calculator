# 🧮 Modern Glassmorphism Calculator

A fully functional calculator capable of performing basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Features a clean user interface, keyboard support, and error handling for edge cases like dividing by zero.

## ✨ Features

* **Calculations**: Powered by a JavaScript `Calculator` class that manages `previous-operand` and `current-operand` states.
* **Keyboard Support**: Full support for number keys, operators, `Enter` for equals, and `Backspace` for deleting.
* **Precision**: Handles decimal numbers and limits floating-point issues using `toFixed(10)`.
* **Error Handling**: Displays "Div by 0" when attempting to divide by zero.

## 🛠️ Built With
* **HTML5**: Semantic structure using custom `data-attributes`.
* **CSS3**: Custom properties (variables), Flexbox, Grid, and Keyframe animations.
